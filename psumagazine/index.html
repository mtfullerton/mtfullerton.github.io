    <p class="job-description">Design and layout of Plymouth State Universityâ€™s alumni magazine. I worked alongside writers and photographers to produce a layout for each story as well as the alumni news and notes section. The process lasted over a month and a half, and included a web portion as well. I worked to update the WordPress website with content for both the Fall 2017 issue as well as the Winter 2018 issue. During the Winter 2018 issue I worked alongside my assistant director to interview current students, teachers, and alumni for a story on hunger on campus. From there our videographer put together the video documentary.
