			<p class="blurb_text">This is a logo designed for a local business specializing in natural treatments. The client was interested in a logo that was light and fun and included a symbol of a person. It was also requested to be in a single color and I choose blue as I felt it demonstrated a professional feel as well as providing a calming atmosphere to the logo. This logo was one of the first that I designed for a professional and learned more about working with a client and respecting their vision.</p>
