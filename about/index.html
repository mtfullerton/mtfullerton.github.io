      <p class="about_text">I am a UX and Digital Designer with a passion for creating simple and effective solutions that fit my clients.</p><br>
      <p class="about_text">I currently work at Plymouth State University and was hired following the completion of my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in graphic design. In just a yearâ€™s time I was promoted to a new position as Digital Designer and Video Editor. I am interested in making quality work and I pay special attention to making sure things are as perfect as I can make them before finishing a job. I also work well when fast deadlines are required and can come up with a quality product even when given little time.</p><br>
