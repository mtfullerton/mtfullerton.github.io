      <p class="about_text">Thank you for looking at my website and my work.  This website contains my best graphic work and will be updated as my work and education progress. I invite you to come back and check out my work in the future.<br><br>
      I graduated from Plymouth State University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and a minor in Communications and Media Studies. I currently work at Plymouth State University as a Graphic and Digital Designer in the Marketing Communication and Creative Services department. I do some minor contract work on the side and am always working on expanding my skillset. More in depth information on my current work can be viewed on my resume or LinkedIn profile.</p>
