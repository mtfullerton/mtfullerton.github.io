			<p>Thank you for checking out my website and my work. This website contains my best graphic work and will be updated as my work and education progress. I invite you to come back and check out my work in the future. I am currently a student at Plymouth State University working toward a BFA in Graphic Design and a minor in Communication and Media Studies. During both the summer and school year I work as a Student Graphic Designer at Plymouth State's Marketing Communication and Creative Services Department. Some of the work I have done with them is illustrated here on the site. I do some minor contract work on the side and am always looking for new opportunities to share my skillset. If you are interested in learning more or contacting me about a job please do so via the contact section of this site. <br><small>Photo Credit: <a href="http://www.kalebhart.com/">Kaleb Hart</a></small></p>
