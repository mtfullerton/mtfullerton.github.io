      <h4 class="casestudy-darkheading">Problem Statement</h4>
      <p class="casestudy-description-white">There are over 3,000 new tabletop games being released yearly making it hard for people to find board games that fit their interests.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="column-objective">
      <h4 class="casestudy-heading" id="tabletop-color">The Objective</h4>
      <p class="casestudy-description">As a tabletop player who has given personal recommendations to others, I wanted to find a way to guide people to board games that fit their playstyle. Over three months I built a solution using the five-step
        design methodology, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. This solution, Tabletop Detective, is designed to help users easily find tabletop games that fit their playstyles and places to try or buy them.</p>

    <h6 class="casestudy-subheading">User Interviews</h6>
    <p class="casestudy-description">Beginning with some background and user research I was able to interview five potential users of this app. Participants were asked about their previous experience buying tabletop games, any current tools they use
      to assist, familiarity with board game cafes and stores, and features they look for in an app. I was able to synthesize this research into a few main categories using an affinity map.</p>

    <p class="casestudy-description">Hearing from potential users helped to reinforce my initial thinking, there was no single source for users to get board game recommendations. Multiple interviewees said they read Amazon reviews but struggled to
      decide if the game was a right fit. Each user had specific qualifiers they were searching for including mechanics, themes, age range, number of players, and more. In one circumstance a user bought a game that they thought they’d like only to
      feel like they wasted $50+ on a game they’d never play.</p>

    <p class="casestudy-description">Hearing a user’s personal struggle helped me to empathize with my user base and better understand their motivations.</p>
    <p class="casestudy-description">A few of my users had been to board game stores before and mentioned it was helpful to work with a store manager. In the best cases, a game could be played before purchasing to make sure they liked it. Users who
      hadn’t expressed interest in finding nearby locations and said they weren’t aware of places nearby. </p>

        <p class="casestudy-description">Before starting on my high-fidelity prototypes I took time to build a style guide for the app. The style priorities were:</p>
        <ul class=casestudy-list>
          <li>A primary focus is the games and information, reduce distracting elements</li>
          <li>Fun feeling, match the attitude of tabletop games</li>
          <li>Contemporary and effortless design</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="casestudy-description">Based on these priorities I developed the style guide below.</p>
        <ul class=casestudy-list>
          <li>The background color of the app would be white and light gray for easy reading</li>
          <li>Bright green, blue, and yellow colors were used for accents to highlight important elements and bring a feeling of fun</li>
          <li>Both fonts were selected for their readability, Nunito letterforms were rounded which added a sense of leisure</li>
          <li>Graphic imagery was also developed for the onboarding screens. All other imagery besides the icons would be pulled from games or locations</li>

      <div class="column-content-l">
        <p class="casestudy-description">When translating my wireframes to high fidelity I made changes to the structure of multiple pages to keep a consistent look across the app. I originally set up a tab system on the search page based on a
          wireframe kit. However, I found the system fit on multiple pages and would reduce vertical scrolling to access certain categories. This also made the design of the home page and game page more distinct. I built a tray system to add a sense
          of depth to the design and to keep the placement of elements consistent.</p>
        <p class="casestudy-description">The tray system also helped when developing micro-animations. Sliding trays in and out built upon the sense of depth in the design. I also created a small animation when swapping between tabs. The animation is
          fluid and quick with a small snap to it which brings a fun and exciting energy.</p>
        <p class="casestudy-description">After creating high-fidelity prototypes I did in-person usability tests with five new users. I asked them to complete similar tasks as my initial testing while also asking questions about the app’s look and
          feel. I was excited that the overall impressions of the design were positive.</p>

    <p class="casestudy-description">As the first capstone project for my UX/UI course, I can safely say it was a learning experience. In my current role as a designer, I don’t get to talk or learn about my end users. Taking time to do user
      interviews and testing helped to open my eyes to their struggles and in many cases, it was just fun to discuss and learn about their experiences.</p>
    <p class="casestudy-description">There were a few times in the process where I ran into a drawback. When creating my style guide I initially used a bright orange for headings and buttons but it had a low accessibility score. This reinforced the
      importance of checking my brand style with accessibility guidelines early and keeping it at forefront of any updates to the app. When planning for my animations I realized I hadn’t done a good job of grouping, organizing, and naming my layers.
      This caused me to take extra time to do so. I’m confident that my next project will be much better managed.</p>
    <p class="casestudy-description">Going forward, I would plan on expanding the social features of the app. These weren’t part of the MVP but would include an expansion of the profile page, a section to show off a user’s favorite games, and an
      option to create lists. Another idea from the research interviews was an option to find local people to group up with to play games together. All of these would be great features to add that fit within the app and user’s goals.</p>
