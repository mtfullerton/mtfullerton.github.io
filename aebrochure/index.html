    <p class="job-description">This brochure was designed for Plymouth State University's Silver Center for the Arts. It includes information on the year's events along with art exhibitions in the many galleries at the university. The 2016-17 brochure grouped events together based on where they were located or by category. The 2017-18 brochure was laid out as a calendar and listed and ordered all of the events by date. </p>
