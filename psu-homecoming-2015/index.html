			<p class="blurb_text">This logo and postcard series were created for Plymouth State University's 2015 Homecoming Weekend. The theme of the weekend is "Once a Panther, Always a Panther" to engage both current students and alumni. To demonstrate the theme I created a retro inspired logo. This allowed me to place the event information inside the logo. I used retro type fonts and texture along with the Plymouth State Panther and signature dark green color. The logo was used by itself for event marketing including a circular magnet given to first year students. The first postcard audience was first year students and their families while the second was sent out to Plymouth State Alumni. I reworked the logo for postcard to eliminate the dates and other information that would be provided elsewhere on the postcard. I used the slant of the original logo again with the photo area on the front to create a more interesting layout. Both of the postcards were requested to be similar on the front but use different photos for the prospective audience. The back of both postcards proved challenging due to the mailing guidelines of postcards. The alumni postcard had a lot of dates to list and it was a struggle to fit all the information there and keep it visually interesting and appealing.</p>
