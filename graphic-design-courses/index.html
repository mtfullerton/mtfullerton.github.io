			<h1 class="blurb_name">Repeated Letter Grid <br><small>Graphic Design, Class Work</small></h1>
			<p class="blurb_text">A project from my first graphic design class that focused on typography. The purpose of the project was to create nine boxes that contained three letter forms each. The positions, size, and color of the letters could be changed in each box. I used the letters "R", "g", and "e". I focused originally on the compositions of each separate tile and then worked to bring it all together as a strong overall structure. We could use shades of gray but no other colors. I worked to connect tiles to others using connected letter forms of the same color. One of my favorite examples of this is visible in the bottom right two tiles with the connection of the "e" and "R".</p><h4>2014</h4>

			<p class="blurb_text">Another project from my first graphic design course. I selected a font and was requested to create a poster design for it. The poster had to include the name of the font, a brief bio on it, and examples of each letter form. I chose the font Century Gothic. I worked to create a relationship between the "C" and "G" of the font's title as my main poster image. Originally the type was a solid color but felt too stagnant for the eye to want to move throughout the poster. I added an orange to red gradient overlay to the type to keep the eye interested.</p><h4>2014</h4>

			<h1 class="blurb_name">Initials Logo <br><small>Graphic Design, Class Work</small></h1>
			<p class="blurb_text">A project for my first graphic design course. We were requested to create a logo based on our initials. The first logo I created using a sans serif font and concentrated on creating tension between the letters with the small space between the letters. I kept this logo black on white because of the spacing. The second logo I created using a serif font. Again I worked on the space between the letter forms and working to direct the viewer's eye through the letters. I also created hierarchy through the sizing of the letters.</p>

			<h1 class="blurb_name">Monkey Logo <br><small>Graphic Design, Class Work</small></h1>
			<p class="blurb_text">A project for my second graphic design course which concentrated on image creation. I was assigned an animal, monkey, as requested to research a specific type and images of the animal. Then draw/trace the animal and work to separate parts of the animal into black and white areas. It was also important to understand the proportions of the body. The logo had to be a single color so the areas between the darks had to describe the form. The movement of the monkey was an important aspect to capture as well so I worked to create the motion of swinging into the logo. Capturing the facial features of the monkey without over describing was difficult. I also added white accents inside the darks and other lines to describe the monkey's fur. </p>
