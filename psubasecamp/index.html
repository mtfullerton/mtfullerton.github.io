    <p class="job-description">During the Winter of 2018 Plymouth State University rented an office in Waterville Valley's Town Square retail area to provide high school students and their families who are visiting the region to learn about the school and meet with admissions staff. This was coupled with a guerilla marketing campaign on the ski mountains near the University. The guerilla campaign logo and style was used to promote the space.</p>
